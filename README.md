# A simple project to connect a RAK3172 with a SI7021 over LoraWAN

The project use the autogenerated files from the STM32CubeMX (lora_fromioc_RAK3172.ioc) and replaced
the files on LoRAWAN/Target with the files provided by Rakwireless for [Low Level Development](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Low-Level-Development/#overview)

The SI7021 library is [STM32 HAL libraries](https://github.com/belyalov/stm32-hal-libraries)
